# LangChain: A Framework for Building LLM Applications

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
- Are context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context (document retrieval, databases, etc.)
- Reason: rely on a language model to reason (chain multiple calls to the model together)

## Key Components of LangChain

### Models
LangChain provides interfaces and integrations for working with language models from various providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and many others.

### Prompts
LangChain provides tools for prompt management, optimization, and reuse. This includes prompt templates, example selectors for few-shot learning, and output parsers.

### Indexes & Retrievers
LangChain offers tools for storing, structuring, and retrieving information from documents or other data sources. These include document loaders, text splitters, vector stores, and retrievers.

### Chains
Chains combine LLMs with other components to create more complex applications. They define a sequence of operations to perform.

### Agents
Agents use LLMs to determine which actions to take and in what order, where actions can include using tools and retrieving information.

## LangChain Use Cases

1. Document Question Answering
2. Chatbots
3. Information Extraction
4. Summarization
5. Code Analysis and Generation
